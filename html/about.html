                        Hi my name is Chun Ho Lee and I'm a fourth year Computer Science student
                        at the University of Toronto. My interest in Computer Science stem
                        from the Computer Science classes I took in highschool. I was fascinated
                        by the fact that written code could behave the same way every time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aside from coding, I enjoy playing board games, watching shows,
                        and playing video games in my spare time. My favorite programming
                        language is Python because of it's ease of debugging which allows
                        for me to get stuff done in an efficient manner. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        My favorite part of being a developer is being able to
                        work with others and really be able to come up with solutions
                        to problems together.
                    </p>
